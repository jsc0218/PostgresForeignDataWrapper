# PostgresForeignDataWrapper

This PostgreSQL extension implements a Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW) for [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/)

RocksDB is a high performance key-value store based on a log-structured merge-tree (LSM tree). RocksDB can efficiently use many CPU cores and fast storage. This is the first foreign data wrapper that connects a LSM-tree-based storage engine to PostgreSQL. Because RocksDB is an embeddable key-value store, you do not need to run another server to use this extension.

This extension can also be used for other systems that have RocksDB-like APIs, but please check the compatibility before you use this extension for other systems.

This extension is developed and maintained by the VidarDB team. Feel free to report bugs or issues via Github.

# Building

We test this foreign data wrapper on Ubuntu Server 18.04 using PostgreSQL-11 together with RocksDB-6.2.4 ( built with GCC-8.3.0).

- Install PostgreSQL and the dev library which is required by extensions:

  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install postgresql-11

  sudo apt-get install postgresql-server-dev-11
  ```

- Install RocksDB from source code:


  ```sh
  cd rocksdb

  sudo DEBUG_LEVEL=0 make shared_lib install-shared
  
  sudo sh -c "echo /usr/local/lib >> /etc/ld.so.conf"  
 
  sudo ldconfig
  ```

- Build this foreign data wrapper with RocksDB:
  
  ```sh
  cd PostgresForeignDataWrapper 

  make

  sudo make install
  ```

- Build this foreign data wrapper with VidarDB:

  ```sh
  cd PostgresForeignDataWrapper 

  make VIDARDB=true

  sudo make install
  ```

- Restart the PostgreSQL server to enable this extension:

  ```sh
  sudo service postgresql restart
  ```

- Uninstall this extension:

  ```sh
  cd PostgresForeignDataWrapper
  
  sudo make uninstall
  ```

# Limitations

- The first attribute in the table definition must be the primary key.

- Composite primary key is not supported for now.  

# Usage

Before using this foreign data wrapper, you need to add it to ```shared_preload_libraries``` in your ```postgresql.conf``` 

```sh
    shared_preload_libraries = 'kv_fdw'    # (change requires restart)
```    

and restart Postgres:


```sh
    sudo service postgresql restart  
```

This extension does not have any parameter. After creating the extension and corresponding server, you can use RocksDB as a foreign storage engine for your PostgreSQL.

A simple example is as follows.


```
    CREATE DATABASE kvtest;  
    \c kvtest  

    CREATE EXTENSION kv_fdw;  
    CREATE SERVER kv_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER kv_fdw;  

    CREATE FOREIGN TABLE test(key TEXT, value TEXT) SERVER kv_server;  

    INSERT INTO test VALUES('YC', 'VidarDB');  
    SELECT * FROM test;  

    INSERT INTO test VALUES('California', 'Waterloo');  
    SELECT * FROM test;  

    DELETE FROM test WHERE key='California';  
    SELECT * FROM test;  

    UPDATE test SET value='VidarSQL';  
    SELECT * FROM test;  

    DROP FOREIGN TABLE test;  

    DROP SERVER kv_server;  
    DROP EXTENSION kv_fdw;  
  
    \c postgres  
    DROP DATABASE kvtest;  

``` 

# Testing

We have tested certain typical SQL statements and will add more test cases later. The test scripts are in the test/sql folder. The corresponding results can be found in the test/expected folder. You can run the tests in the following way:


```sh
    sudo service postgresql restart  

    cd PostgresForeignDataWrapper

    sudo -u postgres psql -U postgres -a -f test/sql/create.sql 

    sudo -u postgres psql -U postgres -d kvtest -a -f test/sql/test.sql 

    sudo -u postgres psql -U postgres -d kvtest -a -f test/sql/clear.sql  
```

# Debug 

If you want to debug the source code, you may need to start PostgreSQL in the debug mode:


```sh
    sudo service postgresql stop  

    sudo -u postgres /usr/lib/postgresql/11/bin/postgres -d 0 -D /var/lib/postgresql/11/main -c config_file=/etc/postgresql/11/main/postgresql.conf
```  

# Docker

We can also run PostgreSQL with RocksDB in Docker container and you can refer to [here](docker-image/README.md).
